random.seed(a=None, version=2)
Initialize the random number generator.
If a is omitted or None, the current system time is used.
If rnadomness sources are provided by operating system, they are used instead of
the system time function for details on availability.
If a is an int, it is used directly.
With version2, a str, nytes, or batearray object gets converted to an int and
all of its bits are used.
